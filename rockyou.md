# We will rock you

## Verse 1
Buddy, you're a boy, make a big noise
Playing in the street, gonna be a big man someday
You got mud on your face, you big disgrace
Kicking your can all over the place, singin'

## Chorus 1
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you

## Verse 2
Buddy, you're a young man, hard man
Shouting in the street, gonna take on the world someday
You got blood on your face, you big disgrace
Waving your banner all over the place

## Chorus 2


## Verse 3


## Chorus 3
